This is my new prototyping template for computer graphics research.  
It's extremely simple: a basic mesh BREP and a few tools to edit it.
It uses path.ux for its framework.

Replaces [my old es5/requirejs template](https://github.com/joeedh/require_skeleton).

# Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/joeedh/research-framework.git
cd research-framework
npm run-script setup

node serv.js
```
